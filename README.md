# auto-zoom
This project utilizes the concepts of Image Processing, Machine Learning, Object Recognition to zoom in on a portion of a computer screen automatically, without the use of a mouse. This is done based on where on the computer screen the user is looking towards. There is an additional sound processing feature in which the user can give vocal commands for the program.
