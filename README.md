# auto-zoom
This project utilizes the concepts of Image Processing and Object Recognition to zoom in on a portion of a computer screen automatically, without the use of a mouse. This is done based on where the user is looking towards on the computer screen. There is an additional feature in which the user is able to vocally command the program to run.
